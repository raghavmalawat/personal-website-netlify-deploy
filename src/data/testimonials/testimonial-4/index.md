“Raghav and I were actively pair programming on various projects. He's got an amazing amount of energy and raises good questions while working on codebase and in product discussions, leading to a different perspective at times. 
Can assure he's a fast learner as well; came up to speed in Ruby on Rails in a short time. Delves deep into the work he does, both in the domain and the product he is building.

Exhibits strong ownership of feature delivery, and ensures all issues raised by various stakeholders are resolved post delivery.

Can vouch he will be a great addition to any team he joins.”
