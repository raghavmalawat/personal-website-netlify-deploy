"I’ve had the pleasure of working with Raghav for a year at CoLearn. He always takes a user-centric approach to problem solving and goes the extra mile to understand the user's problems well before building a solution. During his time at CoLearn, he spent several days in Indonesia, interviewing students and parents to understand their pain points around STEM education. He was able to bring these learnings back to work and apply them to produce better solutions for these students! 

Raghav’s genuine curiosity and initiative to fix what is broken truly sets him apart as a Product Engineer!"
