“Got to work with Raghav various times at MyGate, some of them being the SOC (Security Operations Control) project and the App Deployment Tool where we worked fullstack. He possesses a deep burning desire to learn and grow, and takes full ownership of things even when things go south. 

Always open to feedback and asking ways to improve not just technically but in other areas of work too. Wish him all the best for his future endeavours and would love to work with him again in future”
