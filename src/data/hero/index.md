Always up for conversations around the Indian equity markets and the startup ecosystem in general 🚀. Currently working as a Product engineer alongside amazing folks at CoLearn.

I have always been fascinated by coding and problem solving in general, started my journey with a QBasic terminal pretty early. I've crossed paths with a lot of smart, hard working folks till now in the industry and hope to meet more similar folks who are as equally passionate about their craft as I am. Cheers 🍻!"
