As a part of the <b>middle of the funnel</b> team I worked on delivering the best live class experience to students in Indonesia.
Ranging from <b>reports to notifications to in-class and post-class practices to conduction of live class</b> in general, I've been an <b>active contributor in helping the product mature over time</b>, both towards engineering and at the product front.
Building a product which your users love is a surreal feeling.

<b>Leaded the entire re-architecture</b> of the backend systems with my pair, starting from conducting interviews with various stakeholders to <b>successful conduction of EventStorming session</b>, eventually leading to
identifying new data models to <b>building domain services the DDD way</b>, keeping <b>separate BFF layers</b> both at web and mobile fronts.

<b>Actively paired at work and performed TDD all the while, keeping the test coverage > 95% all the time.</b>

While working at CoLearn I've met and worked with some really smart minds and have <b>inherited a lot of underappreciated skills</b>, be it effective async communication which is quite necessary in a <b>remote setup (our team spanned across 3 timezones)</b> or good debugging skills to even understanding the importance of good documentation and writing <b>decision records</b>.

Tasted building software and product in one of the finest ways here, this has been one of the major factors behind me holding some strong opinions now.
All the brainstorming with PM's on the whole education system, digging deep to understand the motivation behind students attending classes to turning their videos on, and to see those metrics move over time, <b>I can proudly say I've formed a different way of building products now.</b>
